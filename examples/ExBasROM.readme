I'm using asl to compile this as a09 doesn't like the #EQU_VARIABLEs used in this assembly.

I've added an option to allow me to mv the ACIA from the default of 0xe000 to whatever I
pass with:

v09 -a 0xA000

The ExBasROM is Grant Searle's port of the CoCo Extended Basic to his Simple 6809 SBC.

Grant uses as9 to assemble that code. I'm pretty sure the code starts at 0xD800 and
fills the ROM (hence 0xE000 won't work well for the ACIA).
